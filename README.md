## Bayesian nonparametrics for heterogeneous causal effects (with different types of data)

This project is sponsored by NRF (the National Research Foundation of Korea): Jun. 2020 - Feb. 2023.

## Spatial Propensity Scores

In this project, we are developing an approach to estimate propensity scores for spatial data that optimally balances covariates. Especially, we will borrow a machine learning technique (GBM) to find the optimal PS. (More to come)

## BART methods for longitudinal analysis

In this project, we are developing a novel Bayesian Additive Regression Trees method for longitudinal data. 
* Please contact <a href="mailto:chanmink@bu.edu">me</a> if you are interested in this project.

## Bayesian Regression Discontinuity 

Regression Discontinuity is an alternative method to estimate local causal effects. We are developing a flexible model (using Bayesian nonparametrics) in this domain.

## TRAP research

This project is about measuring traffic related air pollution using statistical methods. We will submit this as a grant proposal.

## Korean PM2.5 Project

In this project, we propose a quasi-experiment design to draw causality around on-going debates about sources of ambient PM2.5 in South Korea. We will examine the extent to which other countries contribute to Korean PM2.5 using simulated air mass trajectories and air quality data.

## R01 project: Improving Accuracy and Reliability in Cancer Screening Tests (PI: Kerrie Nelson)

I recently joined this project and am developing a Bayesian method to model rater diagostic skills in ordinal classification processes.

* Please contact <a href="mailto:kerrie@bu.edu">Dr. Kerrie Nelson</a> if you are interested in this project.

## Collaboration with the UBC Education Department and Statisticis Department

I've been collaborating with colleagues at University of British Columbia (Canada) on multiple projects which involve rigorous and complex statistical modelling. Especially, we are interested in applying novel statistical methods into educational data.
