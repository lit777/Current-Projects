## Spatial Propensity Scores

In this project, we are developing an approach to estimate propensity scores for spatial data that optimally balances covariates. Especially, we will borrow a machine learning technique (GBM) to find the optimal PS. (More to come)

## Semiparametric latent models for heterogeneous causal effects (with different types of data)

We will submit this as an R21/R01 grant proposal. Specific Aims are available upon request.

## TRAP research

We will submit this as an R21 grant proposal. Specific Aims are available upon request.


## Korean PM2.5 Project

In this project, we propose a quasi-experiment design to draw causality around on-going debates about PM2.5 level in South Korea. We will examine the extent to which other countries contribute to Korean PM2.5 using simulated air mass trajectories and air quality data.

## R01 project: Improving Accuracy and Reliability in Cancer Screening Tests (PI: Kerrie Nelson)

I recently joined this project and am developing a Bayesian method to model rater diagostic skills in ordinal classification processes.

## Collaboration with the UBC Education Department and Statisticis Department

I've been collaborating with colleagues at UBC on multiple projects which involve rigorous and complex statistical modelling. Especially, we are interested in applying novel statistical methods into educational data.
