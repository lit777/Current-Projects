## Spatial Propensity Scores

In this project, we are developing an approach to estimate propensity scores for spatial data that optimally balances covariates. Especially, we will borrow a machine learning technique (GBM) to find the optimal PS. (More to come)

## Semiparametric latent models for heterogeneous causal effects (with different types of data)

The overarching goal of this project is to develop Bayesian semi-parametric methods for estimating causal heterogeneous treatment (and mediation) effects of clusters from different types of data. We focus on two broad areas: 1) cross-sectional outcome (binary, count or zero-inflated outcome) and 2) time-to-event (survival) outcome with single/multiple (binary, count, continuous) mediators. Our new Bayesian approach will simultaneously generate data-driven clusters of study population and estimate corresponding cluster-specific effects. Also, our approach will provide greater flexibility than parametric models, while maintaining computational advantages. Our methods have broad applications, and we will utilize them to draw novel clinical inference from several behavioral intervention trials
In clinical research studies involving treatment comparisons, there is often interest in examining the extent to which the comparative effectiveness of the treatment strategy or the effect through mediating variables differs across the study population. It is therefore of great importance to have statistical methods that can handle the potential complexities of these data, without relying on strong modeling assumptions and investigators’ manual evaluation of the effects for each covariate of interest.

We will use a fully data-driven way (Dirichelt process mixture / product partition model) to detect clusters of study population based on their all available characteristics and this information will feed into flexible Bayesian semi-parametric outcome (and mediator) model to estimate cluster-specific effects. This process will be done simultaneous during MCMC sampling step, such that any heterogeneous effects estimated from the outcome model, but not detected from the clustering procedure, will inform the clustering procedure to consider more clusters.

Recently, we have successfully developed an initial model for estimating causal mediation effects of clusters for continuous outcome data, however, the model generally doesn’t perform well with a large number of potential effect modifiers (e.g., genotypes, socio-economic status) and it is not straightforward to extend this to general outcome models. 


## TRAP research

There is growing concern about the health impacts of traffic-related air pollution (TRAP) given the fact that more than 45 million people in the US lived in within 300 feet of a highway, a railroad, or an airport in 2009 and this number is increasing [1,2]. While associations between TRAP exposure and adverse health outcomes are well documented, their causal relationships remain an open question due to many spatially-correlated con- founding factors [19]. Moreover, existing TRAP studies are typically localized to specific near-roadway areas [ref], and national studies equipped to identify causal relationships are non-existent to our knowledge. We pro- pose the first comprehensive national study for examining causal effects of exposure to TRAP on public health outcomes. Our proposed study will leverage modern GIS and statistical tools to develop a national database of a proxy measure of TRAP exposure from major roadways for every ZIP code in the entire US. This database will be used with modern statistical techniques [3,4] to estimate regional and temporal heterogeneity of TRAP health effects and assess which of a broad range of factors determine such relationships.
The “comprehensive national study” comprises 43,014 ZIP code areas and all major roadways (by the US Census Bureau’s Census Feature Class Codes; CFCC) in the US. We define roadway exposure by combining data on ZIP code land area with information on the locations of major roadways, daily traffic volume and prevailing wind, and link the exposure to cardiovascular and respiratory disease hospitalizations among Medicare and Medicaid beneficiaries. This forms the integrated ‘massive dataset’ with which we estimate public health impacts of different exposure levels. [we plan to do the following pilot study] We have pilot tested a simple version of the proposed roadway exposure based only on distances from the roadway locations for year 20XX and the results suggested positive associations between the exposure and cardiovascular/respiratory disease rates. With the complete version of roadway exposure containing all relevant information, we will examine the effects of exposure to TRAP on public health conditions in different causal settings (i.e., overall, heterogenous, longitudinal) by carefully adjusting for spatially-correlated confounders and using a set of applicable statistical techniques.
